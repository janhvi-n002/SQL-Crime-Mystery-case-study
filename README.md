# SQL-Crime-Mystery-case-study

##  Project Overview
This project is a **SQL case study** focused on solving a crime mystery by analyzing data from multiple relational tables.  
The objective is to extract meaningful insights using SQL queries and identify key suspects through logical analysis.

##  Dataset Description
The database consists of the following tables:

- **crime_scene**  
  (Date, Type, Description, City)

- **person**  
  (Id, Name, License_Id, Address_Number, Address_Street_Name)

- **drivers_license**  
  (Id, Age, Height, Eye_Color, Hair_Color, Gender, Plate_Number, Car_Make, Car_Model)

- **gym_members**  
  (Id, Person_Id, Name, Membership_Start_Date, Membership_Status)

- **gym_check_in**  
  (Membership_Id, Check_In_Date, Check_In_Time, Check_Out_Time)

##  Objectives
- Explore and understand the database structure
- Analyze crime records based on location and type
- Identify people linked to vehicles and gym memberships
- Use SQL joins to connect related tables
- Apply filtering, aggregation, and conditions to narrow down suspects

##  SQL Concepts Used
- SELECT statements
- WHERE conditions
- INNER JOIN
- COUNT and aggregation

 ## How to Use
Import the SQL file into MySQL / PostgreSQL / any SQL-supported DB
Execute queries step by step
Analyze results to solve the mystery
- Data filtering
- Logical problem-solving
